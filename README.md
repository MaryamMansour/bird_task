# Flutter Task

This Flutter application focuses on implementing a login functionality, guided by design specifications provided in the Adobe XD file. The architecture is designed following the Clean Architecture principles, separating the codebase into data, domain, and presentation layers. The project utilizes various packages such as Dio for handling API requests, Shared Preferences for token storage, ScreenUtils for responsive screen design, and includes custom fonts loaded from the assets directory.
## Project Structure
The project structure is organized into the following layers:
data: Contains the implementation of data sources, repositories, and models.
domain: Defines the use cases and business logic of the application.
presentation: Includes the UI layer, containing screens, widgets, and Cubit for state management


## Libraries and Packages Used
- Dio: Used for making API requests. It simplifies the process of sending HTTP requests and handling responses.
- Shared Preferences: Utilized to store and retrieve tokens locally, providing a simple way to persist data between app sessions.
- ScreenUtils: Employed for creating a responsive design, ensuring the app looks consistent across various screen sizes.
- Cubit: Chosen as the state management solution for its simplicity and scalability.



## Note
- just to mention that there was no specific image provided for the background in the Adobe XD file. As a result, the background might not be accurately represented in the implementation.

- The development of this project follows a Git branching model
  from the master branch there's the auth branch t o develpe the Authentication feature
